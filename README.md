# Handling-Missing-Values

Missing values happen when some information is not recorded for a variable

#     Missing Completely at Random (MCAR):
        It means missing data is randomly spread throughout the dataset. There's no pattern to why data is missing.
        For example, in a survey, if people with missing answers are chosen randomly and their missing responses aren't
        related to anything in the survey.

#     Missing at Random (MAR):
        This type means the chance of data being missing depends only on the data we already have, not on the missing data itself.
        For instance, in income data, if people choose not to report their income, but this choice is related to their age or gender, 
        not their actual income.

 #   Missing Not at Random (MNAR):
        Here, the probability of data being missing depends on the missing data itself. It's not random.
        For example, in job satisfaction and income data, if less satisfied employees are more likely to not report their income, it's 
        not random because it's linked to job satisfaction, which we're not directly measuring.
